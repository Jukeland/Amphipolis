# Amphipolis

When you run the code (through an IDE, unfortunately I wasn't able to create an executable file yet) a window pops up where you can input the 
number of players you want to play with (1 or 4, 1 means that the other player is the computer). After that the game pops up based on what you 
picked or the programm terminates if you clicked Cancel or the X button.

How to play:

    On your turn, perform the following actions, in sequence:
    
    Draw Tiles: Press the Draw Tiles button. That picks at random 4 tiles from the bag and puts them on the board as buttons or just images (if they are landslide tiles)
    
    Take Tiles: Choose up to 2 tiles from one sorting area. The game is built this way that you can't choose 2 tiles from different areas. When you click the button for
                the tile you want to take, that button will disappear and the tile will be displayed in your inventory which is on the bottom of the screen.
    
    Use Character (Optional): You may optionally use the ability of one of the characters. Note that in this version of the game the Professor doesn't work.
    
    End Turn: Press the End Turn button. That passes the turn to the next player.
    
Character Moves:
    
    Archaeologist: Take up to 2 tiles from any sorting area other than the one you chose earlier in your turn.
    
    Assistant: Take 1 tile from any sorting area.
    
    Digger: Take up to 2 tiles from the sorting area you chose earlier in your turn.
    
    Professor : Take 1 tile from each sorting area other than the one you chose earlier in your turn. (Doesn't work in this version of the game)
    
I hope you enjoy!
